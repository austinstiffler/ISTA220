1. A *console application* is an application that runs in the command prompt window.

1. Two differences betrween .NET Framework and .NET Core are:
	(1) .NET Core applications do not provide the range of features available to the complete .NET Framework.
	(1) .NET Core applications are portable and can run on other operating systems, such as Linux.

1. Main() or 'the main method' designates the program's entry point, and is necessary for the application to be executed. 

1. 'TextHello.sln' is a solution file. A solution file is included in each application. Its purpose is to help organize the projects that it contains.
   'TextHello.csproj' is a project file. A project file references its files containing source code and other artifacts for the project, such as graphic images.
   'AssemblyInfo.cs' is a C# source file. The code written for the console application will be in this file.

1. The purpose of a *namespace* is to distinguish and organize large code projects by creating containers for items, such as classes.

1. A *using statement* is a directive that brings namespace into scope and frees you from having to fully qualify the names of classes in your code.

1. Main() is the entry point for a console application. The App.xaml file provides the entry point for a UWP application.

1. An *assembly* is a file that that is a compilation of code and usually has the .dll file name extension, although strictly speaking, executable programs 
with the .exe file name extension are also assemblies.

1. There are 19 different versions of the WriteLine() method.

1. None. There is no relationship between an assembly and a namespace.

1. A *graphical application* functions on any device with a graphical user interface.

1. Build will compile C# code and converts it into an executable program.

1. *Bytecode* is program code that has been compiled from source code into low-level code designed for a software interpreter.
    *Microsoft Common Intermediate Languate (CIL)* is the intermediate language binary instruction set defined with the CLI specification.
	CIL instructions are executed by a CLI-compatible runtime environment.
   Yes. I think CIL is a bytecode because source code is translated into CIL code.
 
1. *Debug* will show a dialog box with exceptions in your code so you can correct them.
