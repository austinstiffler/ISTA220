1. variable *= number; | variable /= number; | variable %= number; | variable += number; | variable -= number;

1. 
	* variable += 5; | variable = variable + 5;
	* variable -= 50; | variable = variable - 50;
	
1. A *while loop* runs until there is no more text to read in the file.

1. A variable that changes each iteration of the loop.

1. If you don't change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block, it will go on forever.

1. 
	* A *for* statement has three parts: initialization, boolean expression, and update control variable. 
	* You can omit all three parts.
	* The expression will run forever.
	
1. Using the *do* statement ensures that a loop runs at least once.

1. The *break* statement is used to exit a loop immediately, and continue at the first statement that follows the loop.

1. The *continue* statement causes the program to perform the next iteration of the loop immediately.
