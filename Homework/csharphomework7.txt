1. A *class* provides a convenient mechanism for modeling the entities manipulated by applications. It defines the kinds of data and functionality its objects will have. When you
design a *class*, you systemically arrange information and behavior into a meaningful entity. **It is the definition of a type**.

1. *Encapsulation*'s two purposes are:
	* To combine methods and data within a class; in other words, to support classification.
	* To control the accessibility of the methods and data; in other words, to control the use of the class.

1. 
	* You instantiate an instance of a class by using the *new* keyword.
	* Create a variable, give it a value, then call it.

1. The default access of the fields and methods of a class is *private*. To change the default, use the *public* access keyword.

1. To write a *constructor*, add a public method that does not return a value and give it the same name as the class.

1.
	* Class methods are accessed by the name of the class, while instance methods are accessed through an instance, or object, of a class.
	* Class fields and methods are created by using the *static* keyword when declaring a method.
	
1. Static *using* statements enable you to bring a class in scope. They allow you to omit the class name when accessing static members.

1. An *anonymous* class is a class that does not have a name. It provides a convenient way to encapsulate a set of read-only properties into a single object without having to
explicitly define a type first. The behavior varies, based on the type of variable. 

1. *Polymorphism* is when code is written without any specification of type, and so can be used with any number of different types specified later. In object-oriented programming,
this is often called generic programming.

1. *Message passing* is a technique for invoking behavior on a computer. The invoking program sends a message to a process and relies on that process and its supporting infrastructure
to then select and run some appropriate code. The caller tells the call method to do something, but it does not tell it how to do it.

1. Alexander Alexandrovich Stepanov is a Russian-American computer programmer, best known as an advocate of generic programming and as the primary designer and implementer 
of the C++ Standard Template Library, which he started to develop around 1992 while employed at HP Labs. I think he simply finds OOP boring, and maybe less of a challenge?
